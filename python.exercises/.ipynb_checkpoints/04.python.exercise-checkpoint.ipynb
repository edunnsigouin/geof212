    "Here you will quantify the annual-mean effect of clouds on radiation at the top of the atmosphere, i.e. the Cloud-Radiative-Effect (CRE), using ERA-Interim reanalysis data similar to Fig. 3.22 in the Hartmann textbook. CRE is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "CRE = F_{net} - F_{net, clear}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where F refers to either net shortwave or longwave radiation flux and the subscript clear refers to the flux without clouds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise walks you through some of the tasks but leaves others for you to do in <font color=blue>**blue**</font>. In order to start this exercise, you must first log on to cyclone, open up this jupyter notebook file '04.python.exercise.ipynb' and make sure your python kernal/environment is set to 'geof212env'. Please refer back to exercise 0 for instructions on how to do this."
